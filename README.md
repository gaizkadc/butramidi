# butramidi
MIDI beat automation with Python.

## Instructions
Run the butramidi.py file and choose:
* tempo (in BPM)
* style (`house` or `lofi` for the moment)
* additional drum tracks besides the ones that come with each style
* number of bass tracks
* number of lead tracks
* number of ambient tracks

A folder named `midi` will be created and every time the script is run, a new beat will be automatically created.
